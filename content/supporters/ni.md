NI need no introduction, creator of LabVIEW!

## Getting There

Please use Spaces 1650 Arlington Business Park, Theale, Reading, Berkshire, United Kingdom, RG7 4SA as the address for your Sat Nav, and park in the Spaces Car Park. 

When you arrive at the business park, Someone from NI should be at reception to greet you, and you will need to sign in with your car registration (please don't worry about the signs about parking charges, this will be sorted when you sign in). 

The NI person will then direct you to the floating meeting pavilion where the event will be hosted.
