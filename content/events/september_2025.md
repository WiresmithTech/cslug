Agenda items could move around but this is a good outline.

NI will be talking about productivity tips for LabVIEW programmers. Always handy to add a few more shortcuts to your work and I know I'm behind a few versions on updates!

YottaVolt will be giving a demo of NI Flexlogger. I'm hoping that it can give us a faster route for basic data capture.

And Steve has some more CTI updates that we can explore (and probably some news from GDevCon too)
